summary: Hollywood-strength editing for everyone
description: |
  Lightworks is the fastest, most accessible and focused NLE in the industry,
  because it is based on the  simple idea that the editor, not the computer
  industry, knows whatâ€™s best. The latest release of Lightworks is based on
  the cumulative knowledge from twenty years of top-flight editing.
