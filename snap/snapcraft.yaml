summary: Hollywood-strength editing for everyone
description: |
  Lightworks is the fastest, most accessible and focused NLE in the industry,
  because it is based on the  simple idea that the editor, not the computer
  industry, knows what’s best. The latest release of Lightworks is based on
  the cumulative knowledge from twenty years of top-flight editing.
